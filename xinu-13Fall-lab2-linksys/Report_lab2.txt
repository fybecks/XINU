In order to simulate starvation, I wrote two methods in main.c, called funcA and funcB. In each of the two functions, there was an infinte loop, in which "This is function A", or "This is function B" was printed respectively.
In the main function, I created two processes, one from funcA, the other from funcB. The former one with high priority, and latter one with low priority. Then when the program is running, the scheduling policy kept the process with high priority running and prevented the process with low priority from running. Therefore, the low priority process never had its chance to run. a starvation of the it was caused.
